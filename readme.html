## **Overview**
The **Docker Django Deployment Project** provides hands-on experience with Docker containerization, CI/CD using GitHub Actions, and cloud deployment on AWS. This project is ideal for those who want to understand how to containerize web applications, automate deployment pipelines, and deploy to cloud environments.

## **Features**
- **Containerized Django Web Application**: Learn how to containerize a Django web application using Docker.
- **Automated Deployment**: Utilize GitHub Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline for deploying the Docker container to AWS.
- **Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications if needed.
- **Volume Management**: Understand and implement Docker volumes for persistent data storage.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## **Installation**
To get started with the **Docker Django Deployment Project**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DCODE-ARMY/Docker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Docker
   ```

3. **Install Docker**:
   - Make sure Docker is installed on your system.
   - If Docker is not installed, follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

4. **Install Docker Compose** (if needed):
   - Follow the [official Docker Compose installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## **Usage**
- **Build Docker Image**: Build the Docker image for the Django application using the following command:
  ```bash
  docker build -t django-docker-app .
  ```
- **Run the Container**: Run the container using Docker:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8000:8000 django-docker-app
  ```
- **Use Docker Compose**: If your project has a `docker-compose.yml` file, start all the services using:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```
- **Deployment to AWS**: The deployment is automated using GitHub Actions.
  - Make sure to configure your AWS credentials and set up the required secrets in your GitHub repository.
  - Push your changes to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and deploy to AWS.
- **Volume Usage**: Add volumes to persist data between container restarts by editing the `docker-compose.yml` file or using the `-v` flag in the command line.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Django**: Web framework used to create the application.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for building and running applications.
- **Docker Compose**: Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool used for automating the deployment to AWS.
- **AWS**: Cloud platform used for deploying the containerized application.
- **Programming Language**: Python (for creating the Django application).


Thank you for exploring the **Docker Django Deployment Project**! I hope it helps you understand Docker, Django, CI/CD, and cloud deployment better. If you find this project helpful, don't forget to give it a star! ‚≠ê
